# latex-plus

Do you tend to forget all the keys for the Tikz PGF plots? This plug-in
has that covered. 

This plugin is meant to play well with other Latex plug-ins, in
particular lervag\vimtex. What it does add is omnicomplete functionality for
Tikz Pgfplots. 

It also adds a few other helpful mappings/funcitons including
* adding \item if previous line contains \item
* italicize WORD under cursor with <leader>ti 
* bold WORD under cursor with <leader>tb 
* auto closing equations \(\) and \[\]
* ability to pull out selected text into new Latex command
